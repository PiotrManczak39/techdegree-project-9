            <p>Delapré Abbey, or more properly, the Abbey of St Mary de
              la Pré, the suffix meaning "in or of the Meadow", is a
              neo-classical mansion and outbuildings which incorporates
             remains of a former monastery in the meadows of the River
             Nene 1 mile (1.6 km) south south-east of Northampton. The
             latter institution was founded as a nunnery about the year
             1145 devoted to the congregation of the great Abbey of Cluny
             in Burgundy, France. Its expansive sloping grounds are a
             nationally-protected Wars of the Roses battlefield, as a
             one-time site of the advance of the Yorkists during the
             Battle of Northampton (1460).</p>

        <h2><span id="pitsford"></span>Pitsford Reservoir</h2>
        <div class="inner-content">
          <p>Pitsford Water or Pitsford Reservoir is a 413 hectare reservoir and
             biological Site of Special Scientific Interest east of Brixworth in
             Northamptonshire.[1][2] It is owned by Anglian Water, which manages
             it as a water park for walking, cycling, fishing, sailing and
             birdwatching.[3] An area of 181 hectares north of the causeway which
             divides the reservoir is the Pitsford Water Nature Reserve, which is
             managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and
             Northamptonshire.[4]
             The reservoir was built in 1956 to supply the town of Northampton, which
             is about 6 miles to the south. Holcot bridge was drowned when it filled
             and was replaced by a causeway a quarter mile further south. The water
             is the 34th largest in England and Wales, with a surface area of 2.85
             square miles. The reservoir is near the village of Pitsford, from which
             it is named. It is also close to Brixworth village and Brixworth Country
             Park, with Holcot on its eastern side.
