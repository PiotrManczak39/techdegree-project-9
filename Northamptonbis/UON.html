          <p id="text">We worked closely with <strong> Bowmer & Kirkland
             Limited</strong> to deliver an exciting campus for the University
            of Northampton. The new Waterside Campus is scheduled to
            open in September 2018 and will be home to 14,000 students,
             with 1,000 students living in a new accommodation village.
            Built on a 58-acre brownfield site, the area was formally the home
             of a large coal fired power station. The area has been transformed with
            the demolition of the old power station and the moving of high voltage
            infrastructure.  Within the site, we have been involved in the design
           of five new academic buildings, restoring an existing listed building
           and all the public realm works across the entire campus.
            We carried out a detailed structural analysis of the steel and concrete
           frames across all the academic buildings to optimise the structural design
           and reduce loads on the structure. This resulted in a significant saving
            of over 380 precast concrete and CFA piles across the entire campus.</p>
